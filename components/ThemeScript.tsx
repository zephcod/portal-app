 * Runs synchronously in <head>, before hydration, so the correct theme is

 * plain inline <script> rather than a React effect — an effect would only
 * run after the initial (light-styled) HTML has already painted.
 *
 * Pure client-side: reads localStorage, falls back to the OS
 * prefers-color-scheme media query, and toggles a class on <html>. No
 * cookies, no server round-trip — so it can never hit the auth middleware,
 * unlike a request for a file or an API route.
